To manually test the model components
1. Go to docker/flask/
2. Run `python model_sandbox.py`
3. A working model is now established, you may interact with it through the interpreter

To launch the webapp entirely:
1. Create a 'config.yaml' file from 'config.yaml.example'
2. Move a license for uploading results to "upload_license.txt" (You may use "uploading_license.txt.placeholder" for testing)
3. Set debug and production admin affiliations in config
4. Add OIDC client secret to config
5. Move your SSL certificate and key to certs/ (Make sure they are called "certificate.crt" and "private_key.key")
5. Run `docker-compose build`
6. Run `docker-compose up`

To enable debug mode, put 'debug: true' into config.yaml

To generate a certificate and key for your localhost, use:
`openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")`
